# GDB GUI

## About

This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the GNU Debugger (GDB).

Its goal is to provide a more intuitive and visual debugging experience by allowing users to:

- View source code
- Set and manage breakpoints
- Inspect program state
- Interact with GDB through a structured interface instead of the command line

The interface is built using Rust and egui, focusing on simplicity, performance, and portability.
